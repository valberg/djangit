# Milestones:

Following is the milestone plan for djangit

## M1: Refactor
Review all variable and function names, and refactor where needed for more
purer code.

## M2: Documentation
Create documentation for every function and explain code where needed.

## Notes:
That should be it for a version 1.0 release though there should be some
testing. But since there is no writing in the repositories there should be no
danger.
