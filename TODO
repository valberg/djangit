# Milestones:

Following is the milestone plan for djangit

## M1: Refactor [DONE]
Review all variable and function names, and refactor where needed for more
purer code.

## M2: Documentation [DONE]
Create documentation for every function and explain code where needed.

## M3: Templates and markdown support
It is like butt-ugly, not that butts can't be beautiful, butt you know what I
mean! So it's about time we get some theming done, and throw some markdown 
parsing in as well :D
